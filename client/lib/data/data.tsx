I'm a Linux-focused Application Support Engineer and Developer with hands-on experience supporting infrastructure and applications across SaaS and on-premise environments. Iâ€™ve solved issues ranging from database failures and broken APIs to VPN, firewall, and server misconfigurations.

I build clean, maintainable software using Node.js, TypeScript, React, and MySQL, always keeping production behavior and stability in mind. I regularly work in CLI environments, review system logs, tune configurations, and create tools that stand up to real-world demands. I'm currently pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect certification to deepen my cloud expertise and expand my infrastructure capabilities.

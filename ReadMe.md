![Dock](./Terminal%20Dock.png)
Need to work on the frontend primarily but there are other features that could be added like email verification for accounts by using something like node mailer with smtp setup using a gmail account or with something like mailchimp

Need to setup a job that checks for inactive posts, users, etc after x dates to delete the data from the system
